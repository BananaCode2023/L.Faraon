    story: 
    `In Bangkong Kahoy Valley, between two magical mountains, The Holy Mt. Banahaw and Devil's Mt. Cristobal , there was an abandoned spot that awakened my interest. It seems like I was able to captured the hidden  beauty of abandonment. 
    
    There are cracks in the walls, but still beautifully standing tall. In life we might have been abandoned by some. But that inherited pain may also be a way to be more tough to treasure the beauty of life itself.`

    story: `
    Imagine that humans are this flower who used to give hope to others, and inspire others with its color and beauty, moments that make people feel wanted and loved. Life is like this flower which also has a purpose for its existence. But there are moments in life where you are left wondering why uncomfortable experiences still exist. Why can’t we just be happy? Too many what-ifs that hold you back. 
    
    It was uneasy because you didn’t feel like it was happening. Like asking for how long this flower will provide us happiness? Some flowers wither rapidly, perhaps in the midst of enjoyment, or at an unexpected time. But whatever life brings, we need to feel, acknowledge, and let things pass. No matter how badly the flower  end, no matter how dry the leaves may take, we must move forward. 
    
    There will always be a butterfly that can add beauty in every  point of our life like this withered and dying flower if we choose to live on  brighter side. Allow yourself to go out into the world and start the next chapter of your story. All we can do at the end of the day is learn from the endings. Embrace and accept the fact that for a moment in time, we felt something beautiful. For a moment in time, we felt loved.

    story: `
    The time when I captured this beautiful still life was the moment when I was deeply exploring the world of art. I asked myself so many things, such as what I could do more as an artist. What further twists can I add to my masterpiece? Why do I need to do this? What is its significance in my life, and so on. I was worried during the process and about the outcome. Still, I enjoyed it in some ways.

    story: `
    I was really inspired by the pet cats of my Mom's cousin namely "Sun" and "Luna". These cats are like the color of the sun and moon which made me remember of how creative the world is. God really made aethetic beings in to the world and we must appreciate everything that He created. 
    
    This is the time where I was exploring deeper into the world of watercolor painting and thought that these cats would be a great inspiration for me to endulge the creativity surrounding us.

    story: `
    After a long day of sailing there will always be a moment of break specially for our hardworking fisherman. I was able to capture the boats docked before the sunset at Sampaloc Lake in San Pablo City, Laguna. Originally, I have painted two more paintings from the boats that was docked before the sunset at the Sampaloc Lake. These boats really inspired me to work harder everyday and remember that in every sunset there will always be a sunrise.

    story: `
    "Ang kasipagan at pag sisikap sa buhay ay parang punla na may kaakibat na kasaganahan". This painting really hits me hard as I go on with my life. Whatever you do in life or whatever you do to others, this symbolizes as the seeds of your good and bad deeds. It is not just how good or bad you are, it is how much you put into perspective of the things that you will reap. As the quote says, "reap what you sow", either good or bad, what matters most is you gain something from everything that you have done.

    "Masayang balik balikan ang ala-alang lumipas sa lumang tahanan. Sa bawat pag sikat ng araw, iniingatan ang nakaraan". I always missed home back when I was in abroad and decided to paint this to always remember that no matter how far I go, nothing beats the warmth of home.

    story: `
    Through the hustle and bustle of life things can get busy and stressful. It is always perfect to come home ,grab a drink to relax, and a time to reflect are much appreciated blessings. I painted, "by the lake" as the vision of what comes to mind as the idyllic spot to spend time in peaceful and far from troubles. As blue skies, Mountains of Banahaw and Cristobal, and brilliant green trees reflected in the Sampaloc Lake. I hope this painting serves as a gateway that leads you to moments of serenity.
